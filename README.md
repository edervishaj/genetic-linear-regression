## Applying Genetic Algorithm for Linear Regression
This is a simple example of the application of Genetic Algorithm in the approximation of the best fitting line to a set of datapoints. While Linear Regression can be solved with much faster methods like Ordinary Least Squares, this shows the wide application of genetic algorithms in optimization problems. This approach can be also considered as a substitute for Gradient Descent.
